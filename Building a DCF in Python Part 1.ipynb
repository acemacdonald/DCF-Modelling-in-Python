    "This notebook introduced how financial modelling works using Python libraries to find the intrinsic value of a stock, in our case, Apple. It took many influences from some great tutorials around the web and a lot of trial and error trying to figure out how to use as few techniques as possible, instead of forcing an answer by combining multiple libraries and complex commands together. That being said, as we move forward it will be necessary to dive deeper into these packages, not just to become more proficient but rather more efficient in terms of drawing insights in a speedy manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next goal, which will be done in Part 2, will be to write a .py file that combines what we've done in this notebook into a single script. The goal will be to take that script, run it by specifying details within a config file, and return the intrinsic value of the share. Ideally, it would be great to have multiple scripts that use the same technique but different methods (as we have seen with the calculation of the free cashflow), to be able to have a more comprehensive view of what the intrinsic value might be, and to also understand on a deeper level the nuances invovled and how to maximise the potential of the python libraries."
